**My App Name:**
**PlayerCombine.com ** <br>
PlayerCombine is for fantasy football players who want to keep track of their favorite players without having to log in and filter through 14 webpages before they can find the data they are looking for. The application which simply offers users a search field where they will be able to search for their favorite players status/related news articles/fantasy ranking. Although, you can search on Google for the player the interface is generic doesnt tell you whether or not the player is healthy / injured / suspended. 

Will be trying to use this API - http://api.fantasy.nfl.com/ and fetching  the query to pull back the json data on the page. 

Should be responsive as well because i plan on using bootstrap framework.
